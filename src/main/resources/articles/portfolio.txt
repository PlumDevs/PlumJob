Building a Portfolio That Gets Interviews
Daniel Kim
A strong portfolio can do what words on a resume can't—it shows, not just tells. Here's how to make yours shine:
1. Focus on quality over quantity
Two polished projects with good documentation beat five half-finished ones.
2. Make it relevant
Choose projects that reflect the kind of work you want to do—frontend, backend, data, etc.
3. Write clear READMEs
Explain what the project is, your role, and how someone can run it.
4. Show your process
Include notes about challenges and decisions. Employers love seeing how you think.
5. Host it
Use GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Heroku to make projects easily viewable. Link them directly on your resume and LinkedIn.
Your portfolio is proof of what you can build. Treat it like your second resume—and keep improving it.
