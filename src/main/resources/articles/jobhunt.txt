Mastering the Tech Job Hunt
Priya Desai
Job hunting in tech is a journey—sometimes fast, often winding. Here are key ways to stay ahead:
1. Network actively
Reach out on LinkedIn, attend meetups, and talk to alumni. Many roles are filled through referrals.
2. Apply smart, not everywhere
Focus on companies aligned with your values and skills. Tailor each application.
3. Prep for interviews early
Don’t wait for the invite. Practice technical and behavioral questions as part of your routine.
4. Track your applications
Use a spreadsheet or a job-tracking tool (like PlumJob). Follow up when needed.
5. Stay encouraged
Rejections happen. Learn from each one, refine your approach, and keep momentum going.
Persistence, strategy, and confidence go a long way. You’ve got this.
